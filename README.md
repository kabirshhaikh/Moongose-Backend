Welcome to the Mongoose Backend Project! This project is a backend application built using Mongoose, Express, and Node.js. It provides a robust foundation for user registration and authentication, utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authorization.

About
The Mongoose Backend Project offers a streamlined solution for managing user accounts and sessions. With a focus on simplicity and security, it allows users to register, log in, and access protected routes securely.

Key Features
User Registration: New users can easily create accounts by providing a username and password.

JWT-Based Authentication: The project employs JWT tokens to authenticate users during the login process, ensuring secure access to protected routes.

Protected Routes: Certain routes are protected and require a valid JWT token for access, adding an extra layer of security to sensitive operations.
